# 5.1 $INIX Token

The Initium native token, $INIX, is capped supply, where the cap is set at 1,130,720,000 tokens, with 500,000,000 tokens available on mainnet launch. However, unlike other capped-supply tokens, which bake the rate of minting perpetually, $INIX is designed to react to changing economic conditions. In particular, the $INIX monetary policy's objective is to balance users' incentives to stake the token versus using it to interact with the variety of services available on the platform. Participants in the platform collectively act as a decentralized reserve bank. The levers available on the Initium are staking rewards, fees, and airdrops, all of which are influenced by governable parameters. Staking rewards are set by on-chain governance and ruled by a function designed never to surpass the capped supply. Staking can be induced by increasing fees or increasing staking rewards. On the other hand, we can cause increased engagement with the Initium platform services by adjusting fees and decreasing the staking reward. Further information on the Initium native token is available on the $INIX [whitepaper](https://inix.initium.foundation) \[17]
