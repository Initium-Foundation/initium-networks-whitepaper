# 5.2 Governance

Governance is critical to the development and adoption of any platform because Initium will also face natural evolution and updates as with all other types of systems. $INIX provides on-chain governance for critical parameters of the network where participants can vote on changes to the network and settle network upgrade decisions democratically. This includes the minimum staking amount, minting rate, and other economic parameters.

Initium Constitution is a native system program that governs the transactions, economic factors, and the inflation rate of the $INIX token via the Minting Mechanism. Initium Constitution is subject to governance.

The Initium governance model is called Imperium, enabling the platform to perform dynamic parameter optimization through a crowd oracle effectively. However, unlike some other governance platforms, Initium does not allow unlimited changes to arbitrary aspects of the system. Instead, only a pre-determined number of parameters can be modified via governance, rendering the system more predictable and increasing safety. Further, all governable parameters are subject to limits within specific time bounds, introducing hysteresis and ensuring that the system remains predictable over short time ranges.

Further information on the Initium governance model is available on the Imperium [whitepaper](https://gov.initium.foundation) \[[18](../appendixes/references.md)].
