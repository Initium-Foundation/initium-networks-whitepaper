# 4.4 Supervisors

Supervisor node plays the role of Cluster Supervisor Bridge (CSB) in the Initium network that replicates the transactions ordered by the Prime node to its pertaining validators squad. The Supervisor node also is responsible to implement the Initium Constitution Craft to check the transactions. The Constitution is a native craft (system program) of the Initium that is governable by the Initium community and can restrict some types of transactions (e.g., stolen funds, rug pulls, etc.,) determined by the vote of the Initium community in the Imperium DAO. If a transaction is not in compliance with the Constitution, the Supervisor node won't send it to the validators for verification.&#x20;

The Supervisor node is responsible to distribute the transactions among the validators in its Legion. It means that the validators in a squad should not verify all transactions and will only validate the transactions that the Supervisor node assigned to each of them. This procedure enables validators with different computation power to join the squad and reduces the number of messages between the validators which subsequently increases the scalability and decreases the time-to-finality.&#x20;

Upon verification of transactions assigned to a validator, the validator updates the state and transmits it to the Supervisor node. Eventually, the Supervisor node aggregates all transmissions received from the other validators in the Legion, updates the state, and sends the finalized state to the Prime node.&#x20;

For choosing a Supervisor node, a Candidate node that has not been elected as the Prime node can form a Legion by establishing a connection between 20 neighboring nodes. If the Candidate node has not received the minimum threshold of 20 votes during the Prime node election, the Candidate can request voting by the neighboring validators to be elected as their Supervisor node.&#x20;
