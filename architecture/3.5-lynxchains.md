# 3.5 LynxChains

Lynx is essentially a protocol for launching Lynx networks––the consortium networks and private blockchains–– based on the Initium technology. Lynx network blockchains are called LynxChains, which benefit from Lynx consensus (an implementation of Covenant consensus with POA properties) Lynx network is where the users can launch their blockchains using the Lynx protocol.&#x20;

In every Lynx network, a pre-defined set of trusted nodes controls the consensus process. These nodes are the existing Certified Initium Validators that the participants of a given private blockchain chose to validate their transactions by paying rent fees in INIX to the validators. Every validator can offer its rental rate in the Lynx marketplace.&#x20;

Although every network on Lynx can have its native token for defined functions on the blockchain (e.g., voting, governance, etc.), the transactions of these networks are conducted on the Initium mainnet and use leptons to pay the transaction fees. A validator may contribute to several consortium networks. The validators must activate their config's Lynx portal to enable the Lynx network. In the meantime, enterprises can run their own Lynx validators by meeting the Initium validator requirements. Lynx network will be available at https://lynx.initium.network.&#x20;
