# 3.2 Hadron

Hadron network is the mainnet of Initium for launching applications, smart contracts, tokens, and transactions on the Initium blockchain using the Rust language. Participants, including validators and stakers, will obtain rewards and fees from the transactions on the Hadron network.&#x20;

Hadron network is designed to integrate all transactions in the subnets of the Initium, including the permissioned blockchains building on the Lynx protocol. This network runs the main consensus, the Covenant.&#x20;

Since it is built on the Rust language, it benefits from parallel runtime, zero-cost abstractions, zero compile-time memory checks, and zero garbage collections. Rust has built-in support for multi-threading, and with its ownership and borrowing rules, developers have been able to write better concurrent code using the language â€” all because Rust prevents data races during compile time.

All transactions on the other Initium subnets, including Castor and Lynx, should finally be sent and verified on the Hadron network.&#x20;

Hadron network will be available by Genesis Event at https://hadron.initium.network
