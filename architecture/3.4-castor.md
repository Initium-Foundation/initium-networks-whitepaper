# 3.4 Castor

Castor is the L2 network of Initium for launching applications, smart contracts, and tokens compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on the Initium blockchain. This network relies on the Hadron network for confirmation of transactions. Using the Castor network, the projects running on  Ethereum-like blockchains (e.g. Polygone, BSC, etc.) can easily integrate with Initium and benefit from its liquidity, scalability, and security.&#x20;

Upon its launch, the Initium validators can join the Castor network and participate in its security and validation process. Castor benefits from the same consensus with the Hadron network, however, the Castor Bridge rollups the transactions in the Castor network and sends them as independent transactions to the Hadron network for verification. Like the Hardon network, transaction fees on the Castor network are also paid with leptons. Upon its launch, the Castor network will be available at https://castor.initium.network.&#x20;
