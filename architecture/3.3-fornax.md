# 3.3 Fornax

Fornax network is the Devnet of Initium. It's a playground for those looking to experience the protocol as a blockchain user, token holder, app developer, or network validator. Fornax network will have the $INIX Faucet, which the users can obtain virtual $INIX for testing their applications and smart contracts before launching on the Initium mainnet. Meanwhile, developers can run their local Fornax nodes to test the Initium networks locally. Fornax network will be available by Genesis Event at https://fornax.initium.network.
