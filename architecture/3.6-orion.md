# 3.6 Orion

Orion is the testnet of Initium and will be available before the other networks. The purpose of Orion is to serve as an environment where recent releases undergo a stress test that focuses on network performance, stability, and the behavior of network validators. Users can use Orion to learn the Initium blockchain before adopting it. All validators support the Orion in the Initium ecosystem. It will be available at https://orion.initium.network.&#x20;
