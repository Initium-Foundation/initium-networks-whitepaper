# 1.5 Native Languages

Initium is being built on the Rust language. It provides zero-cost abstractions, generics, and functional features. For many developers, these solve most of the problems of other low-level languages, such as memory errors and building concurrent programs. Rust has been used to build many great websites and products such as [1Password](https://1password.com/), [Figma](https://blog.figma.com/rust-in-production-at-figma-e10a0ec31929), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Coursera](https://medium.com/coursera-engineering/rust-docker-in-production-coursera-f7841d88e6ed), [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/), [Dropbox](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/epic-story-dropboxs-exodus-amazon-cloud-empire/), and more.

Rust is an amazing language for developing blockchain technology as it is already used by Polkadot, Parity, and Solana and many platforms in their ecosystems. Rust is often cited as a language of choice for systems programming by developers because it combines best-in-class speed with shallow resource usage while offering the safety of a standard server language. Rust solves problems associated with C/C++, such as garbage collection and security.

However, to provide broader use cases for the Initium blockchain and ease of migration of the Ethereum-like dApps and smart contracts to Initium, a parallel implementation of the Initium protocol in the Go language is also considered. This implementation will take place through the Castor network as an L2 solution that enables such dApps and smart contracts to benefit from the Hadron network using the internal Castor Bridge.&#x20;
