# 1.4 Technologies

Initium Labs uses the advantages of various technologies and concepts and mixes them in the form of a new technology called the Initium protocol. Some of the notable technologies and previous works that the Initium, especially its consensus, is benefiting from them are:

* **RATF Algorithm:** Raft is a consensus algorithm that is easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in fault tolerance and performance. The difference is that it's decomposed into relatively independent subproblems and cleanly addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems \[[7](../appendixes/references.md)].
* **Multi-Level BFT**: the MLBFT consensus mechanism reflects that the validator/guardian division provides multiple levels of security guarantee \[[8](../appendixes/references.md)].&#x20;
* **DRBFT**: DR-BFT consists of three sub-algorithms, String Consensus, Data Correctness Validation, and Binary Consensus. String consensus tries to reach a consensus on the data of end devices or edge servers, and the sub-algorithm is based on an agreement and borrows some ideas from the Phase King Protocol \[[9](../appendixes/references.md)].
* **Multi-Threshold BFT**: Multi-threshold BFT has four separate fault thresholds for safety and liveness under synchrony and asynchrony (or partial-synchrony), respectively \[[10](../appendixes/references.md)].
* **Hybrid BFT:** Hybrid-BFT: Optimistically Responsive Synchronous Consensus with Optimal Latency or Resilience \[[11](../appendixes/references.md)].&#x20;
* &#x20;**Proof of Time**: Proof-of-Time (PoT) is a decentralized consensus algorithm that works by selecting validators in proportion to their ranking scores and fixed stake \[[12](../appendixes/references.md)].
* **Blockchain Bridge** \[[13](../appendixes/references.md)].
