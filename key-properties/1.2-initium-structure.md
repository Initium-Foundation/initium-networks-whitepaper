# 1.2 Initium Structure

In the Initium network, each network participant maintains, authorizes, and updates new entries. A collection of blocks with transactions in a specific order represents the structure of the Initium blockchain. These lists can be saved as a flat file (in .txt format) or a simple database. Using the Lynx network, the participants can also run their own blockchain networks on Initium's Lynx network using the Covenant consensus or the Lynx consensus (a version of the Covenant consensus of Initium with PoA capability). Such blockchain networks' architecture can take public, private, or consortium forms.&#x20;

As illustrated in Fig. 1, the Initium blockchain consists of various structures interacting with each other to deliver a highly scalable, decentralized, secure, and cost-effective network for launching applications and smart contracts, transaction of data, and storing the value within a distributed and decentralized network.&#x20;

* **Infrastructure**: Every blockchain's content is stored on a server in a data center somewhere on this lovely globe. Clients request content or data from application servers while browsing the web or utilizing any apps, known as the client-server architecture. Clients can now connect with peer clients and share data. As a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, Initium blockchain is a large group of computers that share data. Blockchain is a peer-to-peer network of computers called validators that computes, validates, and records transactions in an orderly manner in the Initium ledger. As a result, a distributed database is created, storing all data, transactions, and other pertinent data. Initium validators can be stand-alone computers running by the users and or cloud-based nodes using AWS or Azure.&#x20;
* **Data**: This is a linked list of blocks in which transactions are ordered. The data structure of the Initium blockchain consists of two fundamental elements: pointers and a linked list. A linked list is a list of chained blocks with data and pointers to the previous block. Pointers are variables that refer to the position of another variable, and a linked list is a list of chained blocks with data and pointers to the previous block. The Merkle tree is a binary tree of hashes. Each block contains the root hash of the Merkle tree and information like the preceding block's hash, timestamp, nonce, block version number, and current minting rate. Transactions are digitally signed to protect the security and integrity of the data contained in the blockchain. A private key is used to sign transactions, and anyone with the public key may verify the signer. The digital signature detects information manipulation. Because the encrypted data is also signed, digital signatures ensure unity. As a result, any manipulation will render the signature invalid. A digital signature also protects the sender's or owner's identity. As a result, a signature is only linked to its owner and cannot be disregarded.
* **Network**: The network structure, commonly referred to as the P2P layer or the Propagation layer, is responsible for inter-node communication. Discovery, transactions, and block propagation are all handled by this structure. Initium's P2P layer ensures that nodes can find one other and interact, disseminate and synchronize to keep the blockchain network in a legitimate state. A P2P network is a computer network in which nodes are distributed and share the workload of the network to achieve a common purpose. The blockchain's transactions are carried out by validators.
* **Consensus**: Consensus is essential for blockchain platforms to exist. The consensus is the most necessary and critical layer in any blockchain, whether it is Bitcoin, Ethereum, Initium, or another. The consensus layer is in charge of validating the blocks, ordering them, and guaranteeing that everyone agrees. The consensus establishes a clear set of agreements among validators and ensures that the power stays decentralized and diffused and, therefore, no single entity (e.g. a node or ecosystem's stakeholder) has complete control over the Initium blockchain. The consensus ensures that one chain is followed and that it contains the truth (the true and complete data).&#x20;
* **Applications:** Smart contracts, interfaces, and decentralized applications (DApps) comprise the application layer. The application layer protocols are further subdivided into the application and the execution layers. The application layer includes end-users programs to communicate with the blockchain network. Scripts, application programming interfaces (APIs), user interfaces, and frameworks are part of it. The Initium blockchain network serves as the back-end technology for these applications, and they communicate with it via APIs. Smart contracts, underlying rules, and dApps are part of the execution layer. Although a transaction moves from the application layer to the execution layer, it is validated and executed at the semantic layer. Applications give instructions to the execution layer, which executes transactions and ensures the blockchain's deterministic nature.
